# Exercises 57 - Static Method
Define inside the class Person a static method called fromObject that takes in an object literal as parameter and instantiate a Person object.

class Person {
constructor(firstName, lastName) {
this.firstName = firstName;
this.lastName = lastName;
}
}

const obj = {
firstName: 'Mario',
lastName: 'Rossi'
};

const person = Person.fromObject(obj);
console.log(person.firstName + " " + person.lastName);
